# **App Name**: AcousticIsle

## Core Features:

- Multimodal Live Input: Captures user's audio input (rhythm, pitch, intensity) via microphone and physical energy/environmental context via webcam using browser MediaDevices API.
- Real-time Multimodal AI Analysis: Utilizes Gemini 1.5 Pro and an Agno agent ('Ethnomusicologist DJ') to analyze live audio (rhythm, pitch) and video (energy, environment) input, acting as a tool to determine appropriate musical accompaniment.
- Dynamic Stem Generation & Playback: Generates and plays culturally accurate, real-time musical accompaniments by dynamically selecting ethically sourced audio stems based on AI analysis of user input, perfectly synchronized via Web Audio API.
- Ethical Royalty Ledger: Visually displays currently playing indigenous stems and updates a 'Community Vault' counter in real-time to track micro-royalties for ethical monetization.
- Interactive UI with Visualizers: Provides a sleek, dark-mode user interface with dynamic, pulsing audio visualizers that react to live microphone input and musical accompaniment changes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted deep violet (#8C5CD7). This hue balances technological innovation with a grounding sense of cultural depth and calm, offering good contrast in a dark theme.
- Background color: Very dark subtle violet (#25222D). Provides a 'dark-mode' aesthetic, ensuring content readability and visual comfort, maintaining hue consistency with the primary.
- Accent color: Vibrant sky blue (#7AD2F0). This bright, analogous accent is used for highlights and interactive elements, adding a refreshing contrast to the primary and background colors.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for its modern, techy feel suitable for dynamic displays. Body text font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for neutral readability, complementing the headlines.
- Use sleek, minimalist line-art icons that complement the dark-mode aesthetic and subtly convey musical or input-related concepts without clutter.
- Employ a responsive and fluid layout, with clear, centralized focus areas for user interaction. Utilize negative space effectively to maintain a clean, high-end feel in the dark interface.
- Implement smooth, subtle transitions for UI elements and state changes. Emphasize real-time, pulsing animations for audio visualizers that dynamically react to input and output, enhancing immersion.
